## OR2017 Workshop: Getting Started with Ansible and ServerSpec
June 27, 2017, Afternoon 1/2 day workshop

## Abstract

Let’s face it, repositories are services, no matter your definition of service. To offer a service like a repository, you need people: repository management staff, developers and operations staff (aka sysadmins). Many repositories scrape by with just a developer or two, maybe a shared sysadmin. A legendary few try to get by with a single staff member, who wears many hats. This isn’t an uncommon challenge for IT professionals. But it’s particularly common among people tasked with delivering a repository service. We do more with less. One way to do more with less is with automation. There are tools to help you manage the task of delivering a service in a more organized fashion. This workshop will walk you through how to use Ansible [1], one such tool, to set up a new service on a new machine. The focus will be on hands-on learning, walking through the common mistakes one can make when using Ansible. You’ll gain a confidence in the tool, and learn that the error messages Ansible returns are actually useful in finding those mistakes. You will quickly discover that using Ansible is pretty similar to what you’ve previously done by hand. You may even have shell scripts written to help you with provisioning; those existing scripts can easily be modified to work with Ansible. We will also make use of Serverspec [2], a tool which allows you to characterize the services running on an existing server, and then use this specification to test and verify the results of your efforts with Ansible.
